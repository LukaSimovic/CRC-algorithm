# CRC-algorithm
The program represents the implementation of the CRC algorithm and was done in Visual Studio 2019 as a console application.
A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data. 
CRCs are popular because they are simple to implement in binary hardware, easy to analyze mathematically, and particularly good at detecting common errors caused by noise in transmission channels.
